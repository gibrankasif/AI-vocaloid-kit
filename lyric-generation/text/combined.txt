When did the autumn breeze begin to blow?
If only I could see you one more time I know I can't.
I wish my love could reach you.
If only I could see you one more time...
I don't want to forget that blue coral reef.
I can't return to those exciting days.
During that season, all of the time spent awake was precious.
We embraced that excitement.
As we walked together, on and on.
When summer ended, our love disappeared as well Farewell.
I believed that our happiness would continue on forever.
So why did you leave me behind?
Those memories are already far, far away A beautiful dream.
Even though my love hasn't changed.
Those memories are already far, far away...
Love is a mirage that will disappear eventually.
I won't forget the heat from the white sand, or the color of your tanned skin.
They'll become precious memories They will, they will.
But even so, these tears will never dry up.
If only I could see you one more time I know I can't.
I wish my love could reach you.
If only I could see you one more time...
I don't want to forget that blue coral reef.
Alone on the beach... sighing to myself...
Alone on the beach... sighing to myself...
In your eyes burns a blue flame; Putting on a strong front, you the LONELIEST BABY.
So, comin' comin' back!
Just staying sulky there doesn't work, you know?
Look over here... Please!
Somehow painful one day, shaking with loneliness one day.
Oh yeah, oh yeah! Teach me my boy.
Aiming for the waiting night sky.
Call me, call me!! The signal you're skipping is "L.O.V.E".
Because I want to hug you with these feelings of love.
I'm gazing at only you right here.
Always I love you I love you I want to tell you I love you I love you.
No matter when　Hi!Hi! Hi!Hi!　Without losing.
I'm praying　Ah...!Let's fight!
I love you I love you Love you love you I love you I love you.
Don't forget during the times when you're tired, just a little bit.
Recall and think about me　Baby!
The oath your seriousness conceived, don't tell it to anyone.
So, goin' goin' now!
If you're too quiet there'll be misunderstandings, you know?
Say something... Please!
Crying in the rain one day, getting drenched and sad one day.
Oh yeah, oh yeah! I want to meet you my boy.
I've been waiting, my heart is calling out.
Call me, call me!! The signal right now is "L.O.V.E".
Once you're in love, everything can be forgiven.
Really... Because I am someone that belongs only to you.
Always I love you I love you Unchanging I love you I love you.
Sometimes　Hi!Hi! Hi!Hi!　Also weak.
What's dear to me　Ah...!I know!
I love you I love you I love you I love you.
Because you're dear to me, when you want to take a break, I want to protect you gently.
I wanna hold you, Baby!
Hi! Hi! Why, I wonder?
Even when you're strong and even when you're weak.
Hi! Hi! I love you!
I love all of it, the lonely my boy.
Your oath, your heart; you are you are, lonely boy.
The passionate you, where is it you're aiming for?
Always I love you I love you Unchanging I love you I love you.
Sometimes　Hi!Hi! Hi!Hi!　Also weak.
What's dear to me　Ah...!I know!
Always I love you I love you I want to tell you I love you I love you.
No matter when　Hi!Hi! Hi!Hi!　Without losing.
I'm praying　Ah...!Let's fight!

Oh baby I love you, oh baby I love you!
You are you are, Lonely boy.
Oh baby I love you, oh baby I love you!
Oh baby I love you!!
No, don’t stop, I’m getting hot from you.
“I’m still dreaming an innocent dream”.
When I whisper that into your ear.
I close my eyes and sigh, It’s your fault.
I dissolve into the sea bathing in the moonlight.
Before diving into love.
I won’t say anything…It’sASecret.
If I speak I’ll turn into foam, I’m a mermaid.
The waves brought me here.
Summer love is a painful festa which won’t come twice.
I dance with the waves so.
Let the magic of sound ring out loudly for this year’s festa.
Are you alarmed? Are you nervous?
I kind of know, I’ll know when I turn around.
I’m getting hot from you.
“Why aren’t you coming here? Are you aware?”.
I’ll try teasing you a bit.
Those painful excuses are so like you.
The tension fills my heart with even more excitement.
Symbols are written in the sand with bare feet.
If you flip it around it reads I love you.
What will you do when you notice? Will you be looking at me?
Next embrace me tightly.
I’ll get away nimbly, Because now is the beginning of love.
I want to be held tightly after that.
You’re so gentle, What I want to know is you acting aggressively.
Are you alarmed? Are you nervous?
I’ll pout over and over, I’ll pout even if we cuddle up.
Spoil me.
The waves brought me here.
Summer love is a painful festa which won’t come twice.
I dance with the waves so.
Let the magic of sound ring out loudly for this year’s festa.
Are you alarmed? Are you nervous?
I kind of know, I’ll know when I turn around.
Let it ring out, Let the summer love ring out.
No, don’t stop, I’m getting hot from you.
The rhythm gradually changes into a sweet Fruits dance.
In a hurry.
Looking back at myself.
I do not look back at what I have caught.
I want to be chased.
But I won't say it; But I can't say it .
So, right?
I'll come around, come around, come around.
Let's dance and come around, come around.
I want fresh experiences no matter what they may be.
What we need is probably a feverish love.
You don't know? Who is going to come?
Waiting like fruits to be harvested.
From a hard, yellow colour. It grows pink.
I'm trembling shaking.
If you reach it now... Yes!
The rhythm gradually changes into a sweet Fruits dance.
In a hurry.
Looking back at myself.
I do not look back at what I have caught.
I want to be chased.
But I won't say it; But I can't say it .
So, right?
I'll come around, come around, come around.
Let's dance and come around, come around.
I don't want to forget every new day.
I hope if you can keep this secret kiss.
Is it too early? Is it good even if only a little?
Fruits are thorny so be careful.
Turning blue with a sweet scent → Transformed and ready to be eaten.
I try to touch it gently.
You... Please do not get lost again!
The passionate, burning hot summer gives out a tingling sensation.
It does not stop.
Hey, I am about to burst in this season.
Surprisingly turning bullish.
I want to be hugged.
But you know, I will blush; But you know, it is embarrassing.
I, right?
It is intense and come around, come around, come around.
I lose and come around, come around.
By the time a white ship comes gliding through the beach.
So that the distance between us may shrink.
A little more... a little more... I try to close my eyelids.
The passionate, burning hot summer gives out a tingling sensation.
It does not stop.
Hey, I am about to burst in this season.
Surprisingly turning bullish.
I want to be hugged.
But you know, I will blush; But you know, it is embarrassing.
I, right?
It is intense and come around, come around, come around.
I lose and come around, come around.
This passionate, burning heat gives out a tingling sensation.
The rhythm gradually changes into a Fruits dance.

Think of where you want to go.
Hurry, let's go!
Having fun could be the key to using your heart.
Brush away all of the things you don't like.

Look up to the sky, and your tears will seem to fade away.

Where is this place?
Wait, even if you don't say it, I already know.
It's a warm mirage I saw in my dreams.
Who are you?
I won't ask because I already know.
This is an encounter called forth by our wishes.
The first star that shines brighter the further it gets.
I always wanted to try a romance like that.
My heart's brakes are no longer needed.
We were born just to meet and become a pair.
Ah! I don't want "Maybe".
I'm an Angel that prefers "More".
I won't let my wings be mere decorations.
Ah! Though I don't want "Maybe".
I'm an Angel that likes "More".
I've realized what's important isn't tomorrow.
But rather the present instead.
My pounding heartbeat can't be stopped.
We've always believed in it and understood,.
that our encounter was for us to collide with each other.
The colder it gets the hotter the flames of my steps.
That's right, I'll bet everything for the sake of love.
Come, let yourself be attracted, just enough to get hurt a bit.
This sparkling tear, is it from joy or from sympathy?
Ah! This passion will last only for this night, and never again.
We'll have to dance until this passion burns out.
Ah! This passion will last only for this night, and never again.
"If you catch me, keep holding on to me tightly," I whispered.
This precious dream has yet to end.
I knew that time couldn't be stopped.
So I wanted to meet you much earlier.
I'll let the words I want to convey dissolve into this sound, and Call Angel!
Ah! I don't want "Maybe".
I'm an Angel that prefers "More".
I won't let my wings be mere decorations.
Ah! Though I don't want "Maybe".
I'm an Angel that likes "More".
I've realized what's important isn't tomorrow.
But rather the present instead.
My pounding heartbeat can't be stopped.
These approaching footsteps, it'll be great if they were you.
Even though I know that can't be right.
This feeling that sticks with and walks alongside me,.
I've started wanting to receive it.
My wordless sighs are freezing up, and disappear presently.
At the street corner where I stand alone.
Your back that I'm searching for .
Can't possibly be in this crowd.
Today, I should've said "I miss you".
Having missed our promise just fills me with regret.
Right here and now, I'll give you a call.
"Come here right now," I want to try telling you that.
Hesitating, puzzling over it, I still haven't decided.
Even while tracing the number of stars with my fingertips.
That day I've come to love, my chest hurts thinking about it.
Hesitating, puzzling over it, I still haven't decided.
The night's getting late, I have to decide soon.
While coming to like it, it seems I've become a little bit more timid.
These approaching footsteps, it'll be great if they were you.
Even though I know that can't be right.
This feeling that sticks with and walks alongside me,.
I've started wanting to receive it.
The sparkling decorations on the window are falling.
If I pick them up I feel like crying unexpectedly.
I have a premonition, that I'll be able to meet with you.
I want to try believing that's no mere premonition.
Actively, I should've said "I miss you".
Obstinately enduring it all somehow.
Right now, our usual place.
I want to try going there, you might just be there.
Hesitating, puzzling over it, I still haven't decided.
The night's getting late, I have to decide soon.
While coming to like it, it seems I've become a little bit more timid.
If inexperienced, even while trembling in the cold.
My cheeks and heartbeat grows hot.
That day I've come to love, thinking about it makes me cry.
If inexperienced, even while trembling in the cold.
Who is that waving to me in the distance?
The one rushing in my direction surely has to be you.
These approaching footsteps, your footsteps.
Are heading straight towards me.
This feeling that sticks with and walks alongside me,.
You're heading here with the exact same feeling.
With a smile, I say "I'll go on ahead" and get on the train.
My lips quiver slightly.
As painful emotion runs through me.
If I could just tell you my feelings.
I wouldn’t sigh and do things like write.
That single name on the glass with my finger.
I wish I could become crystal clear.
As I stand in front of you as your friend.
This throbbing in my chest that can't be kept hidden.
I don’t want anyone to notice it.
Return the person I was, with her heart on her sleeve.
Even though we're friends, I'm in love with you.
I can’t hide it anymore, I can’t forget about it.
With the secret locked within me, I leaned against the window.
As the scenery streaming by changes, tears come trickling down.
I play it off by pretending to yawn.
And look up to gaze outside.
Having you near me is painful.
You're just too kind.
Knowing you've made a habit of talking to that girl.
Is breaking my heart.
Someday, I want to dream about being tied together.
The way lovers are drawn to one another.
It's my selfish desire, my painful wish.
I don’t want anyone to notice it.
I wanted to dream about our hearts being tied together.
Obtaining the happiness that lovers have.
My selfish desire  I'm sorry, without a doubt.
This secret, marginal love will remain mine alone.
The day we first met won’t fade away even now.
Why does it continue to sparkle within my memories?
I wish I could become crystal clear.
As I stand in front of you as your friend.
This throbbing in my chest that can't be kept hidden.
I don’t want anyone to notice it.
Return the person I was, with her heart on her sleeve.
Even though we're friends, I'm in love with you.
I can’t hide it anymore, I can’t forget about it.
With the secret locked within me, I leaned against the window.
Why do I feel so cold? feel so mute.
Being stared at with intensity feel so dizzy.
I wanna get fired up yet why feel so nude.
Diamond princess style.
Even if I carry a brilliant shimmer.
Something’s missing…Agitating my heart.
Things like pretty girls swaying in dreams.
Are affairs which should stay in movies.
That’s something no one understands.
Begone! Words like “Protect me…” won't leave my mouth.
Rather than being a frail and fragile thing, I want to melt in the flame of passion.
You up to the challenge?
Love me to the point of caution get my love.
I wanna cry painfully Trembling all over.
Closing the lid on reason get my land.
The princess wars are gonna break out.
Seduce me, embrace me madly.
If I forget about it all… I won’t need tomorrow.
Rather than a guardian clad in light.
I whispered that I want the fragrance of darkness instead.
That’s no good, huh? You don't get it.
Visions of a disappearing future  nobody wants to see that.
Do you understand? A frightened prince is a bore, you know.
I want to stay the way I am  electrifying.
Sparkling princess, Sighing princess.
Being ordinary’s a nono, no more safety.
While I, the melancholic princess, am awake.
I want my heart to be thrown into disarray.
Things like pretty girls swaying in dreams.
Are affairs which should stay in movies.
That’s something no one understands.
Begone! Words like “Protect me…” won't leave my mouth.
Rather than being a frail and fragile thing, I want to melt in the flame of passion.
You up to the challenge?
Let's deliver happiness and smiles to everyone...
I think I'm starting to understand the sound that flows through my body.
Our meeting wasn't unexpected.
It's a miracle that we're so attracted to each other.
It's important to have a dazzling smile that believes in the future.
Love is like a sun, a big sun.
The sunflowers lift their heads to follow it.
Love is like a sun, illuminating the world.
I want to bloom with the sunflowers.
I want everyone to be full of joy!
Let's always be singing with a smile...
That's right, your eyes were so gentle as you frolicked.
Before the tears began to spill.
You nodded beautifully at me.
Do your best, my heart; tomorrow we'll be going to a new world.
The clouds of love bask in the light.
And are softly enveloped in it.
The clouds of love bring with them a warm breeze.
Let's feel it together.
And prepare to embrace everyone now!
Do your best, my heart; this is important.
Now, a new future will be born for you and I.
Love is like a sun, a big sun.
The sunflowers lift their heads to follow it.

Running through the wind.
You’re running again today.
My eyes follow as you sweat on the school grounds.
No matter how far I’ll notice at any time.
“Do your best! Don’t get crushed!”.
My heart shouts out.
If you’re serious a chance will come.
You have to catch it.
Before the throbbing in your chest disappears.
Look, I say fight! For your sake.
I’ll push your back with a smile.
Become number one, It will be you!
I say fight! That’s my cheer.
You’re still on fire.
So definitely don’t give up.
A dreamless dream isn't a dream.
Raindrops are glittering.
Glittering on your face.
I want to wipe the dirt off the ball.
Even on days like this you have to bring out all of your spirit.
“Do your best! Stand firm!”.
I’ll embrace you with all my heart.
You’re serious, The sparkle in your eyes.
Looks dazzling.
The flames of battle rage.
Now, I wish you to fight! I’ll push your back.
Toward whatever you face.

A humming fun melody blossomed.

A wind blew, I want to be swept away by an intense gale.
You suddenly noticed…Noticed that I want to see you.
Waiting to go home after school’s unbearable.
Leaning within the shadows of the trees along the road alone.
Even if I look down and count just the footsteps it’s no good…No, no good!
Feel the fate Is what I wish for.
This is the first time the uneasiness in my chest has made me want to cry.
Unknown Love*Teach me Love.
I’m inexperienced, I dizzily Cry.
Looking at someone this way.
Have I changed so much?
Unknown Love*Teach me Love.
I’m a coward yet I can’t stop.
When I attempted to go a little beyond my limits.
A wind blew, I want to be swept away by your gale.
My heart throbbed…Throbbed from my hastening heartbeat.
The curiosity’s hotter than the paininducing fever.
Get closer to me, I want you to call out to me.
Still not knowing even each other’s names, I hate it…Hate, hate it!
If I believe in fate It’ll come true.
We shouldn’t need things like words, Let it start with our eyes.
Childish Heart*Opening Heart.
Am I purehearted? There’s still more to go mind.
This feeling of love is a yet unknown adventure.
How will I change?
Childish Heart*Opening Heart.
Hold me and take me to the moon.

If we combine our feelings together.
Perhaps we can manage somehow or another.
Our power is tiny but.
We have dreams we want to nurture.
There’s much we don’t comprehend.
There are nothing like roadmaps in our pockets.
It’ll be okay even if we just progress little by little.
Let’s stick our chests out proudly and push forward.
What will you do when you mess up?
Why not try smiling? With a smile shout “Yay, yay, yay!”.
We’ll be fine singing with genuine and honest voices.
One, two, three, four.
Everyone, over here!
Someday, Our wishes will come true someday.
Someday, Let’s have faith that they’ll make it someday.
There’s no point in crying like that, After all.
The fun has still just, still just begun!
The worries are neverending.
Even if we look back and sigh.
We’ll cheer each other on.
I’m glad we were together again today.
Teaching and being taught.
It’s so pleasant, Our friendship multiplies.
When we can’t help but fight.
We’ll spring back and apologize.
Nod impressively!

You’re the knight of the white moon, The hand I felt is still warm.
Don’t let go and hold me tight.
I call this miracle love.
Chase it honestly, chase it with courage.
A small wish will create tomorrow.
It’s possible if everyone wants it.
Try harder than anyone, maintain your passion.
What we aim for is the beautiful path where the wind blows.
Raise your arms as if they were wings.
And fly to the dazzling future.
I’m sure I can hear the sounds of youth, it can be heard in that moment.
When you smile everyday will be okay!
I’m sure I can hear the sounds of youth, I want to see that moment.
Stay by my side What a pleasant sight.
And I’ll be by yours.
I want to see you honestly, I want to see you energetically.
Under the glistening rays of the sun streaming down.
What we talk about is everyone’s future.
Someone said that things will come true of we believe in ourselves.
Perhaps I understand that miracles should be grasped.
Take in the frustration.
And journey to the world you envision.
Finally youth is budding, I want to give you this pleasant feeling.
Wherever you are stretch out proudly.
Finally youth is budding, I love this pleasant feeling.
You’re really here It’s always lovely.
And I’m really here for you.
I’m sure I can hear the sounds of youth, it can be heard in that moment.
When you smile everyday will be okay!
I’m sure I can hear the sounds of youth, I want to see that moment.

Why is it, that the piercing wind fills the streets.
Why is it, that the sunset is full of pain.
The autumncoloured trees' leaves are my love,.
They all seem like they're about to fall.
Does my voice reach you?
The sky I asked, foretells a labyrinth of love.
Because I like you Because I like you And because I like you And because I like you.

The summercoloured memories are my love.

The way you’re always here by my side is something I’ve felt as a regular thing,.
But I’ll cherish it more.
Let’s dream and laugh – I don’t want to lose that.
We’re friends. La la la la… Forever!
As we’ve shared the same experiences,.
We move the same steps closer to adulthood.
Things will keep going that way forever, I expect….
I want to find out for sure, but I don’t really know how.
Even if I have faith that things won’t change,.
Just a little bit of loneliness crept in.
When I was watching the profile of your face.
The way you’re always here by my side is something I’ve felt as a regular thing, La la la la.
But tomorrow just might hold one step down a different road.
The way you’re always here by my side is something I’ve felt as a regular thing, Always….
But I’ll cherish it more.
I don’t want to lose you – don’t let go of my hand.
We’re friends. La la la la… Forever!
I tried pretending that I was strong,.
So I actually became strong – we’ve tried so hard together.
Not being alone is a happy feeling.
You’ve listened to me in times of worry – you’ve saved me.
Inside, I wish that things won’t change.
Is that just me being selfish?
But it would really be great if we could stay together, on and on….
Dreaming, laughing, crying – let those days we spent shine bright. La la la la.
They’re a treasure more radiant than any precious stones.
Dreaming, laughing, crying – those days we spent together are so dear to me. Dreaming….
I’d like to add on even more,.
Though we haven’t decided what we should aim for next.
We’re friends. La la la la… Forever!
Don’t say that it’s just for now – this is eternal.
Don’t say that it’s just for now – wow, wow….
I want to see the dream, together with you.
I want to see the dream, to laugh and cry… Ah!
The way you’re always here by my side is something I’ve felt as a regular thing, La la la la.
But tomorrow just might hold one step down a different road.

A maze of dreams... A maze of lilies...
When your eyes filled with longing.
Are searching far away.
I feel such loneliness.
And want to tell you I'm right here.
Ah! Just the two of us, to the Garden of Glass.
There's no one else; we don't need anyone else.
I want to bloom softly as if I'm about to break.
On our secret swing.
Swinging with you now.
Just gazing at each other softly.
A girl who's fallen in love with love; her quiet sigh is .
Lonely... contented and lonely...
So that your heart that I wish to capture.
Won't go anywhere.
Please stay here with me forever.
It's lonely.
Ah! In the maze of dreams, the glass butterflies.
While tempting me, they're being tempted.
I'll flap my fingers, as though they're about to break.
Our secret romance.
And even though I want to feel you.
All we can do is painfully gaze at each other.
The feelings we can't have as girls who are in love with love.
Why do they have to be so painful?
We'll fall asleep in our Flower Garden.
I love your hand as it strokes my hair; more...
Our secret romance.
And even though I want to feel you.
All we can do is painfully gaze at each other.
The feelings we can't have as girls who are in love with love.
Why do they have to be so painful?
On our secret swing.
Swinging with you now.
Just gazing at each other softly.
A girl who's fallen in love with love; her quiet sigh is .
Lonely... contented and lonely...
A maze of dreams... A maze of lilies...
